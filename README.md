# **MedInsure AI – Medical Insurance Cost Prediction**

MedInsure AI is a machine learning–powered web application that predicts individual medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle information. The project combines a trained Random Forest regression model with a modern web interface to provide accurate, real-time predictions.
In The backend FastAPI is already deployed and accessible, while the frontend allows users to input details and view predicted insurance costs.



## **Features**

Predicts medical insurance charges using ML
Uses demographic & lifestyle features:
Age
Sex
BMI
Number of children
Smoking status
Region

Includes feature interactions (age × smoker, BMI × smoker)

Displays:

Predicted insurance cost
Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
Model performance metrics (R², MAE, RMSE)
Clean and responsive frontend UI
Backend served via REST API



## **Machine Learning Model**

Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Reason for choice:

Handles non-linear relationships well
Robust to outliers
Performs better than linear models for this dataset
Final Model Metrics

R² Score: ~0.89
MAE: ~₹2300
RMSE: ~₹4400
Built using FastAPI
Provides a /predict endpoint

Accepts JSON input and returns predictions
